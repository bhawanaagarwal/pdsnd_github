### Date created
30th Aug 2024

### Project Title
Bike-share analysis for cities - Chicago, New york, and Washington

### Description
This project analyses the statistics for chosen city by the user. This analysis can be further filtered down to chosen month and date by the user. 
The statistics include:
Total and average travel time
Most traveled hour, day and month
Most frequent Start and End Station
Number of User Types
Most frequent birth year

The project handles edge cases like filling nan values with the most frequent values as dropping null values will lead to only one type of user in the dataset.

Also, it is known that using mode for filling nan values is not the optimal solution. We will work on this later using other imputation methods.

### Files used
Chicago, New York and Washington dataset in the csv format
The python file is of .py format - bikeshare_2.py

### Credits
This project is inpired and guided by the udacity nano degree course - Programming with Python.
